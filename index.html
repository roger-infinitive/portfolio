      <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I am experienced game developer and systems programmer with over 7 years of industry experience.
        I previously served as CTO of the start-up VisualLive, which was successfully acquired by Unity Technologies.
        At Unity, I led a team of 8 senior developers as Team Lead and Software Manager, delivering high-performance AR/VR solutions for AEC.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Today, I run my own indie game studio and I am working towards shipping Cultist Astronaut by the end of the year.
        My expertise includes building custom engines using C/C++, developing gameplay systems, and creating editor tools for artists and designers.
        I also have my hands in gameplay and level design.
        I've designed and implemented systems for 2D and 3D rendering, character physics, audio, and animation.

	  <h2>Unity Reflect</h2>
        
        <p>
            During my time at Unity Technologies, I managed a team of 10 senior developers. Our team was responsible for migrating the best parts of VisualLive to the Reflect / Digital Twins ecosystem.
            I was personally involved in improving UX for Augmented Reality on HoloLens and iPad.

	  <h2>VisualLive (Unity C#)</h2>
	  
        <p>
            VisualLive is an AR/VR solution for the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry, designed to run on both the HoloLens and iPad. This cloud-based platform enables users to process and visualize complex 3D models directly on the job site.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the development team lead, I was responsible for:
            <ul>
               <li> Managing and coordinating a team of engineers </li>
               <li> Collaborating directly with customers to understand pain points and shape feature development </li>
               <li> Optimizing model processing and rendering performance across platforms </li>

      <ul>
		<li>
            <strong>Beneath the Tranquil Waves</strong> (3-day Game Jam)  
            – Explores ocean restoration through purifying and reviving sea life. Implemented flocking AI where fish follow the player as their leader.
        </li>
        <li>
			<strong>Morpheus</strong> (College Capstone, Team Lead of 10+)  
			– A 3D exploration game with shapeshifting mechanics. Led a large team, coordinated across design, art, and engineering disciplines.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Spunky</strong> (Prototype)  
			– Created a "ghost replay" system for recording and racing against previous player runs.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Chrono Crack</strong> (2-day Game Jam)  
			– Designed around time travel loops. Jump through time rifts to explore different time periods. Structures degrade and nature grows.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Camp Demise</strong> (2-day Game Jam)  
			– A 2D horror game where players use a flash light to ward off enemies in the darkness.
