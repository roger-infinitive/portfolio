      <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I am experienced game developer and systems programmer with over 7 years of industry experience.
        I've worked as a CTO for a successful start-up company, VisualLive, which was acquired by Unity Technologies.
        At Unity, I worked as the team lead and Software Manager for a team of 10 senior developers.
        In the present day, I am running my own indie game studio and working towards shipping a title towards the end of the year.
      </p>
      
      <p>     
        My expertise in building custom engines using C/C++, as well as delivering gameplay systems, tools,
        and enemy AI. I've built performant systems for rendering (both 2D and 3D), physics, audio, and animation pipelines. 
        Currently seeking contract or freelance opportunities involving game development, game tooling, custom-engine development, or Unity programming.

      <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Game Development: C, C++, Unity (7+ years)</li>
        <li>Custom engines, rendering, AI behavior trees, physics, UI systems</li>
        <li>Tools: Spine 2D integration, shader programming, tilemaps, asset pipelines</li>
        <li>Platforms: Windows, Xbox, DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan</li>
        <li>Low Level: Assembly, Memory allocators, Data-oriented practices, SoA vs. AoS </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Highlighted Projects</h2>
      <h3>Cultist Astronaut (Custom Engine - C/C++)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Built a full 2D engine with custom rendering, audio, animation, scripting, and UI systems</li>
        <li>Integrated Spine 2D animation, AI behavior trees, and optimized 2D batching for sprites and tilemaps</li>
        <li>Designed internal tools for level editing, debug rendering, and special effects</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Unity Tool Programming</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Created plugins for importing, converting, and optimizing high polygonal meshes. Many of theses meshes were in the millions and sometimes close to 1 billion triangles. 
        Optimization included deduplication of vertices, instancing meshes, options to remove small details, and merging geometry to reduce draw calls.</li>
        <li>Developed custom editors for importing and modifying game assets. Specifically created a table-style editor for mass editing data for a game.</li>
      </ul>
	  
      <h3>Hobby Projects</h3>
      <p>
        A few personal and jam games built to experiment with mechanics and technical challenges.

        </li>
        <li>
			<strong>Morpheus</strong> (College Capstone, Team Lead of 10+)  
			– A 3D exploration game with shapeshifting mechanics. Led a large team, coordinated across design, art, and engineering disciplines.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Spunky</strong> (Prototype)  
			– Created a "ghost replay" system for recording and racing against previous player runs.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Chrono Crack</strong> (2-day Game Jam)  
			– Designed around time travel loops. Jump through time rifts to explore different time periods. Structures degrade and nature grows.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Camp Demise</strong> (2-day Game Jam)  
			– A 2D horror game where players use a flash light to ward off enemies in the darkness.
